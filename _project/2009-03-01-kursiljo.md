Web Site of Kursiljo Croatia was created in March of 2009. using Joomla! as CMS. For that time it was used to show basic contact informations about Kursiljo (Cursillo) and when people can register to go on Catholic Camp on Krapanj Island. It was running Joomla as CMS for a while until early 2018. when it was switched to WordPress which is running right now. My role as Web Administrator started in late 2019. when I helped with fixing one problem and now I’m responsible for putting out online news about all things about Kursiljo Croatia events.
