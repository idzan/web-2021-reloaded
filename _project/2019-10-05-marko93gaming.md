Small promotional Web Site for “Marko93 Gaming” started as blank idea to create simple, but still useful web site for new project of mine, namely like YouTube Channel which I wanted to create few months ago just to keep it up with old Gaming Videos which I made for multiple Channels that I owned or was one of contributors. Web Site is built using Custom Grid Layout. Web Site is hosted on Netlify Services and it is git synced with GitHub where are source files.
