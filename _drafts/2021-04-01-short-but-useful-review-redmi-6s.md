So, this will be short and creative review of Realme 6s which was bought from our mobile operator for super cheap.

Specifications of device can be found [on GSMArena](https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_6s-10268.php){:target="blank"}. There are few changes which aren't noted in GSMArena are NFC which works (yeah, it works, tested it with Google Pay and [Revolut](https://www.gsmarena.com/realme_6s-10268.php){:target="blank"} Visa card and yes, it works fine).

Just to be clear, this was and still is my secondary device which I mostly use to watch some videos (pirated mostly and YouTube), play games on that smooth 90Hz refresh rate LCD Display and do some thing that I don't wanna to do on my main [Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro](/month-of-usage-for-xiaomi-redmi-note-9-pro-better-known-as-review-of-phone/) like test out new applications.

As a matter of fact, this device have separate Google Accounts and it is also setted up to be used with old Xiaomi Mi Band 4 (and yes, don't judge me but I'm using Mi Band 5 for almost a month now and I'm impressed how better detections are, but more about all of it later on or in next post.)

## Device Specifications and nit pickings

So, yeah. I will note some exceptional specifications like 30W Super Dart Charging (yeah, Realme is sub-brand of Oppo)
