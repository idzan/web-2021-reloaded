So, let&#8217;s premise this review with one important thing &#8211; I&#8217;m writing this review from this phone which I&#8217;m reviewing. Yes, I love it so much that I wrote it in Notes application and later on copied in Google Docs so it can be synced with PC from which it is published. What a perfect combination for writing review for Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro.

Now, why I bought this device and how it is to use it. Reason that I bought it for around 210â‚¬ (approximation of price from Croatian Kuna) in August of this year is that I had to move back to Android after a month with iOS (to be precise iPhone 6 running iOS 12.4.5). Plus I moved to iOS just because that was only option to buy when my [Samsung Galaxy A7 (2018)](https://idzan.eu/long-term-review-of-samsung-galaxy-a7-2018/) got broken while on vacation on Krapanj Island.

Here is a thing &#8211; I wanted to move from Samsung to Xiaomi right about this time because pricing of solid mid-range Samsung phones went nuts. But really nuts. For example on day when I bought my phone cheapest and really next stepping stone with solid phone was Samsung Galaxy A51 which was priced about 350â‚¬ (approximation from Croatian Kuna).

### Battery and Specifications of Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro

For my budget (which was around 300â‚¬ at that time) this is perfect device. For starters, with specifications it is great for higher end of mid-range devices. For me it is higher end because it is having Gorilla Glass 5 on front and back and because of Camera Specifications. Basics for Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro are Snapdragon Qualcomm 720G which is based on 8nm process, 6GB of RAM, 64 or 128GB of storage which is expandable via microSD cards, 64MP + 8MP + 5MP +2MP Cameras on back with 16MP Camera in punch-hole design on 6.67 inch 2400 by 1080px LCD. More details about specifications can be found on [GSMArena](https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_note_9_pro-10217.php){:.link__external}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="blank"}{:aria-label="GSMArena (Opens in new tab)}. As you might see, this is Global version of phone, just to note because there is same name for this phone for Indian market (and Indian model is for other parts of world known as [Xiaomi Redmi Note 9S](https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_note_9s-10147.php){:.link__external}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="blank"}{:aria-label="Xiaomi Redmi Note 9S (Opens in new tab)}).

Some things that got me to this phone and not [Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Lite](https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_mi_note_10_lite-10183.php){:.link__external}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="blank"}{:aria-label="Xiaomi Mi Note 10 Lite (Opens in new tab)} which I could get in my budget are fingerprint reader in power button and expandable storage via microSD card.

Now to review &#8211; Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro is great device as you might not see until now. As I&#8217;m mostly mid to heavy duty user it can keep it up with my usage.

In start I have to note big battery &#8211; 5020mAh. This is major improvement in my phone collection. The biggest battery with Turbo Charging. Yes, charging. In box we got 33W Power Brick with USB-PD and Quick Charge Compatibility. This brick with original USB-C to USB-A cable can charge device in about hour. Seriously, once I got around 18% of battery charge in morning and I had to go to daily biking and after about hour it got charged to 100%.

As I&#8217;m talking about battery and charging &#8211; this brick of battery can survive in average for 2 and half days with full charge on my even heavier usage with average of 7+ hours of Screen on Time (SoT). My usage is WiFi, 4G (only when I&#8217;m not near WiFi), Bluetooth (for connection to Xiaomi Mi Band 4, Xiaomi Mi True Wireless Earbuds Basic S and computer when near it), GPS (for sports tracking in Mi Fit and Google Fit) and finally NFC (as most of payments trough COVID-19 is with NFC and Google Pay connected to multiple cards).

As for other specifications, well I have nothing special to say. I&#8217;m experienced with mid-range specifications of phones, this Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro is snappy in day to day usage. Even for lighter gaming (tried with Call of Duty Mobile for few hours) it is all fine. Screen brightness isn&#8217;t like Sasmung Galaxy A7 (2018) which was rocking AMOLED display, but is readable even on bright sunny day.

### Camera tests and shots from Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro

Now to major part of this phone and why I got it &#8211; cameras. Yes, I use phone cameras for almost all of my photos which are published online and which will be seen in Photography and Graphics Portfolio (when I finish design for it). Main camera is 64MP with f1.9 which is bit &#8220;worse&#8221; then previous camera on Samsung phone, but for me it isn&#8217;t big change. Camera shots from main camera sensor and make it 16MP in final form just to make file size smaller. And sensor is really great.

There is also 64MP mode which create [big chungus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YDoowoYzOI){:.link__external}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="blank"}{:aria-label="Big Chungus, meme video (Opens in new tab)} of photos. Those are really big so I will provide to see them [Google Photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Zg1uYFcm3gTK1VLf7){:.link__external}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="blank"}{:aria-label="View 64MP photos from Redmi Note 9 Pro on Google Photos (Opens in new tab)} Gallery.

For night mode which is available in Camera application photos are solid. Most of them are shot from hand without any stand or tripod. Also for this phone is available Google Camera (GCam) mod which enables Astrophotography Mode. Those Astrophotography Mode shots are looking like it is mostly daylight and not freaking night.

Ultra-wide camera can create pretty much great shots just like old Samsung phone.

Macro camera is also fine, it can keep it up with details on nearby objects.

As for selfie camera, well I can say that is perfect in my honest opinion (as I can say myself ðŸ¤£).

All shots can be viewed in [Google Photos Gallery](https://photos.app.goo.gl/uUhjembAFvYJU8hq8){:.link__external}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}{:target="blank"}{:aria-label="View photos from Redmi Note 9 Pro on Google Photos (Opens in new tab)} with all details as I backup all images at Original Quality.

Video quality is solid for a phone with this price. I can say that videos are better then on old device. In 4K recording mode it doesn&#8217;t have EIS, but in 1080p modes (30 and 60FPS are here) it is having EIS. There is no OIS, but EIS is just fine. Down below are few examples of 4K 30FPS, 1080p 60FPS and 1080p 30 FPS Shots created in this month of using it.

In conclusion of this brief review of phone which I&#8217;m using for a month now I can say few things and those are &#8211; man, I freaking love Xiaomi eco-system. Especially for somebody who prior to buying this phone had Xiaomi Powerbank 2C in 20000mAh Capacity and Xiaomi Mi Band 4 (prior to buying it I had some cheap clone of it which broke in less then a month of usage and battery was ðŸ’©). With this I will keep it up with Xiaomi devices in future which might get to me Xiaomi flagship phones in Mi Series, not like today in Redmi mid-range based phones. As big plus, I&#8217;m currently moving whole family to Xiaomi phones from their Samsung&#8217;s and Cubot&#8217;s.

All photos and videos are my property, and all (except cover image which is shot with iPhone 6) are created with Xiaomi Redmi Note 9 Pro within this month of usage. All images are hosted on Imgur and Google Photos as they are too much for this server.
